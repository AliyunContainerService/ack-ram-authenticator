= Contributing

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ First off thanks for taking the time to contribute ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This project is extremely simple and gives a generic way to get a version out of
your `goreleaser` and `cobra` projects. All the code is contained in a single
package `version.go`.

== Roadmap

If you are interested in contributing to this project here are a couple things
that I would like to add.

1. **Issue: link:https://github.com/christopherhein/go-version/issues/1[#1]**
   Support for custom attributes `-X main.foobar=<blah>` and updating
   `goVersion.New()` to take a splat or map of addition params.
2. **Issue: https://github.com/christopherhein/go-version/issues/2[#2]**
   Ability to Output to `yaml`
3. **Issue: https://github.com/christopherhein/go-version/issues/3[#3]**
   Func for taking in a type string and outputting the right response
+
**Example:**
+
[source,go]
----
info := goVersion.New(...)
info.Output('json')
----
4. **Issue: https://github.com/christopherhein/go-version/issues/4[#4]**
   Tests 😳
